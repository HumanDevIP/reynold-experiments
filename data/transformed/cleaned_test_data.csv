A method for directing and tracking translation lookaside buffer TLB shootdowns within hardware comprising detecting by one or more processors each processor comprising one or more processor cores that a process executing on a first processing core causes one or more virtual memory pages to become disassociated with one or more previously associated physical memory addresses generating by the first processing core a TLB shootdown request and transmitting by the first processing core the TLB shootdown request to others of the one or more processing cores the TLB shootdown comprising a shootdown address indicating the disassociated virtual memory page or pages to be flushed from the respective TLBs of the other processing cores a notification address indicating where the other processing cores may acknowledge completion of the TLB shootdown request and identification information.,An additional difficulty encountered when virtual addresses or virtual address spaces are being remapped is that other processes or threads seeking access to the affected virtual addresses cannot access the information without causing inconsistent or fatal results.Therefore in a multiprocessor computer system maintaining a consistent view of a virtual address space in a multithreaded process is critical.To obtain this consistent view requires synchronization by the operating system kernel across all of the processors in the system whenever a process virtual address space changes.Thus when virtual addresses are changed they must be changed for all processes and all processors across the entire system this process is referred to as synchronization.Such an operation requires that the old translation table entry for a given virtual address be removed called demapping or unmapping and a new translation table entry having a different physical address be entered.This is referred to a TLB shootdown.Additionally all TLB shootdown events must be synchronized across the entire virtual address space for all CPUs in the system.Such synchronization prevents inconsistent mappings so that no single virtual address maps to more than one different physical address.Thus the TLBs of all CPUs for any given virtual address all map to the same translation table entry.,0
